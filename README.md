# Game-Builder

This Game Builder is a turn-based game creator that allows you to define status effects, players, enemies, allies, and abilities, and have the players and allies fight using their given abilities. Eventually, this project intends to include progression of player characters against more and more challenging enemies. It is currently in a development state, and has not been released. The current build can be played through this repository, but it is subject to any changes.
